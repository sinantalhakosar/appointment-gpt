### This file is for explaning why we have /routes/ask.ts router
While developing this project I was sometimes asking questions to chat-gpt
But in those times 12/07/2023 (DD/MM/YYYY) there was some operational problems on chat-gpt servers
Fortunately, api was working fine
So I created this route to ask my questions.
